The Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture classically provides a connection between the arithmetic of elliptic curves and their $L$-functions. In this prelimiary section, we explore the classical definition of $L$-functions attached to an elliptic curve and their twists, and we explore some of the relevant properties that we will use later on. To do so, we first need to explore the notion of an Artin representation and of an $\ell$-adic representation. 

Throughout this section we fix a field $K$, which will either be a number field or a local field of characteristic $0$. We always specify what $K$ is in each context. We also fix an algebraic closure $\hat{K}$ of $K$ and we denote by $G_K$ the absolute galois group $\Gal(\bar{K}/K)$ of $K$. We recall that $G_K$ is a profinite group
$$G_K=\varprojlim_{F}\Gal(F/K),$$
where $F$ ranges over the finite Galois extensions of $K$ and therefore has a natural topology where a basis of open sets is given by $\Gal(\bar{K}/F)$ where $F$ is a finite extension of $K$.
