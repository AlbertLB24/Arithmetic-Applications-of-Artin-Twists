As we discussed in Section \ref{sec_pos_rank}, our motivation is to use Theorem \ref*{thm_positive_rank} to predict points of infinite order for families of elliptic curves. However, in Sections \ref{sec_cyclic} and \ref{sec_odd} we prove that in the theorem will never make such a prediction with the group is either cyclic or has odd order. In other words, in such cases, and after fixing some representation $\rho$ of the Galois group, the product
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_localprod}
    \frac{\prod_i C_{E/F_i}}{\prod_j C_{E/F_j'}}
\end{equation}
arising from a $\rho$-relation is always a norm from every subfield $\QQ(\sqrt{D})\subseteq\QQ(\rho)$. The aim of this section is to introduce useful notation {\color{red} Are we finally introducing notation in this section?} and important results that will be used throughout in the next sections, where the main results of the document are proven. The results are number theoretic in nature, and we exhibit two technical consequences of these results on elliptic curves.
