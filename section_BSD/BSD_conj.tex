The Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture classically provides a connection between the arithmetic of elliptic curves and their $L$-functions. We have already investigated the construction and main results of the `$L$-functions side', and now we turn out attention to statement of the conjecture and towards understanding the arithmetic terms present in the conjecture. Some arithmetic terms present in the conjecture are easier to describe if the elliptic curve has a global minimial Weierstrass equation. Since we will be mainly interested in elliptic curves over $\QQ$, and in view of Propostion \ref*{prop_globmin}, we will assume throughout that $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\QQ$ with \textbf{global minimal Weierstrass equation}
$$E:y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6$$ 
for some $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6\in\ZZ$, and let 
$$w=\frac{dx}{2y+a_1x+a_3}=\frac{dy}{3x^2+2a_2x+a_4-a_1y}$$
be the associalted \textbf{global minimal differential}.
