As observed in the introduction, we will be considering Artin representations over $\bQ$ that factor through finite Galois groups $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. Our methods in this report apply the theory of finite group representations to the study of elliptic curves over finite Galois extensions. This section introduces some representation-theoretic concepts that we will apply in later sections. 

The first two subsections discuss rational representations of $G$, and writing these as a sum of virtual permutation representations.
In the third subsection, we consider functions defined on subgroups of $G$, corresponding to subfields of $F / \bQ$. Our main example of interest is the function sending $H \mapsto C_{E / F^H}$ for $H \leq G$ \footnote{this is the fudge factor that appears in the BSD quotient for $E / F^H$}. We also describe \textit{$D$-local functions}, which are functions that depend on a decomposition group, borrowing definitions that appear in \cite[Section 2.iii]{reg-const}.

We have attempted to make this first section mainly representation-theoretic, in case the results within can be applied in other contexts.

\subsection{Rational characters and permutation representations}\label{rep}

\begin{defn} 
    Let $G$ be a finite group, $K$ a field of characteristic zero.
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item A \textbf{representation} of $G$ over $K$ is a group homomorphism $\rho \colon G \to \GL(V)$ where $V$ is a $K$-vector space.
    \item  Associated to a representation $\rho$ is a \textbf{character} $\chi \colon G \to K^{\times}$, defined by letting $\chi(g) = \Tr \rho(g)$ for $g \in G$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

If we don't specify the field a representation is defined over, assume it is defined over $\bC$. For complex representations, $\rho$ is determined by its character; if $\rho$, $\rho'$ are representations with identical characters, then $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are isomorphic as representations (cf. \cite[Chapter 2, \S 2.3]{Serre}). 

%\begin{defn}\label{rep-ring}
%Let $\chi_1, \ldots,  \chi_h$ be the distinct characters of the complex irreducible representations of $G$, where $h = \#$ conjugacy classes of $G$. 
%Then the \textbf{representation ring} of $G$ is 
%\[ \R(G) = \bZ \chi_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \bZ \chi_h .\]
%We can also view this as the Grothendieck group of the category of finitely generated $\bC[G]$-modules.
%\end{defn}
%Since we take differences of characters in $\R(G)$, we call elements of $\R(G)$ \textbf{virtual representations}. 

Let $K$ be a number field. Denote by $\R_K(G)$ the group generated by characters of the representations of $G$ over $K$. A representation of $G$ is then defined over $K$ if and only if its character is in $\R_K(G)$ (\cite[Proposition 33]{Serre}).
$\R_K(G)$ is a subring of $\R_{\bC}(G)$, where $\R_{\bC}(G)$ is finitely generated by $\Irr(G)$; the irreducible characters of $G$ over $\bC$.
When $K = \bQ$ this is called the \textbf{rational representation ring}.
The characters of the distinct irreducible representations of $G$ over $K$ form an orthogonal basis of $\R_K(G)$ with respect to the usual inner product of characters of $G$ (\cite[Proposition 32]{Serre}).
Let $m$ be the exponent of $G$. If $K$ contains the $m$-th roots of unity, then $\R_K(G) = \R_{\bC}(G)$ (\cite[Theorem 24]{Serre}). This implies every representation of $G$ can be realized over such $K$. 
\vspace{1em}

%The rank of $R_K(G)$ is discussed in {\color{red} Serre 12.4}.
Let $\Perm(G)$ be the ring of virtual permutation representations of $G$ (i.e. the ring generated by the characters of $\bC[G / H] = \Ind_{H}^G \trivial$ for $H \leq G$). Let $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ be the ring of rationally valued characters of $G$. Then we have inclusions 
\[ \Perm(G) \to \R_{\bQ}(G) \to \Char_{\bQ}(G). \]
Each of these groups have equal $\bZ$-rank, equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$ (\cite[Chapter 13, \S13.1]{Serre}). Moreover the cokernels of these maps are finite.

\begin{defn}\label{rho-norm}
    Let $\rho$ be a representation of $G$. We define the norm of $\rho$, denoted $\repnorm{\rho}$, by 
    \[
    \repnorm{\rho} \defeq \sum_{\fg \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}  \rho^\fg \quad,
    \]
    where $\bQ(\rho)$ is the abelian extension of $\bQ$ generated by $\{ \Tr \rho(g) \colon g \in G \}$, and $\rho^\fg$ is the representation of $G$ such that $\Tr \rho^{\fg}(g) = \fg(\Tr \rho(g))$ for $g \in G$. 
\end{defn}

It's clear that $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ is generated by the characters of $\repnorm{\rho}$ as $\rho$ ranges over the complex irreducible representations of $G$. Indeed, if a representation has a rationally valued character, then any complex irreducible constituent must occur along with all its Galois conjugates with equal multiplicity.

\begin{rem}
This is not additive, i.e. one does not have \[\repnorm{\rho + \tau} = \repnorm{\rho} + \repnorm{\tau}. \] 
This does hold when $\bQ(\rho) = \bQ(\tau)$. 
\end{rem}

\begin{example}
    Let $G = C_p$ and $\psi_p$ a character of order $p$. Then $\bQ(\psi_p) = \bQ(\zeta_p)$ and $\repnorm{\psi_p}$ is the sum over the $p - 1$ non-trivial characters of $G$. But $\repnorm{\psi_p + \trivial} = \trivial^{\oplus (p - 1)} + \repnorm{\psi_p} \not= \repnorm{\trivial} + \repnorm{\psi_p}$.
\end{example}

%Conversely,  Therefore our map $R(G) \to \Char_{\bQ}(G)$ is surjective.

%Such a character may not be in $R_{\bQ}(G)$, however. That is, it has rational character, but the corresponding representation cannot be realized over $\bQ$. The quotient $\Char_{\bQ}(G) / R_{\bQ}(G)$ is the study of Schur indices.  If $\rho \in R(G)$ is an irreducible representation, the \textbf{Schur index} is the smallest integer $m(\rho)$ such that 
%\[ \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}m(\rho) \cdot \rho^\sigma \quad \in R_{\bQ}(G). \]

\begin{rem}\label{image-of-burnside}
The group $$\C(G) \defeq \frac{\Char_{\bQ}(G)}{\Perm(G)}$$ is a finite abelian group, of exponent dividing $|G|$ (this follows from Artin's induction theorem, \cite[Theorem 17]{Serre}). The study of this group is quite subtle. For us, it's enough to know that given a representation $\rho$ of $G$, there exists a minimum integer $m$, depending on $\rho$ and dividing $|G|$, such that 
\[ \repnorm{\rho}^{\ \oplus m } = \bigoplus_i \Ind_{H_i}^G \trivial \ominus \bigoplus_j \Ind_{H_j'}^{G} \trivial \]
for some subgroups $H_i$, $H_j' \leq G$, i.e. that the character of $\repnorm{\rho}^{\ \oplus m }$ is in $\Perm(G)$. This minimum integer $m$ is the order of the character of $\repnorm{\rho}$ in $\C(G)$. 
\end{rem}
%Thus, we have a map $\Irr(G) \to \Perm(G)$. We extend this additively to a map $R(G) \to \Perm(G)$.
\begin{example}
If $G = C_n$ then $\C(G)$ is trivial (see Example \ref{cyclic-relns}). $\C(G)$ is also trivial for the symmetric groups $G = S_n$. 
\end{example}

 \begin{example}
    $G = Q_8$, the quaternion group, has $\C(G) = \bZ / 2 \bZ$. Let $\rho$ be the faithful irreducible representation of $G$ of dimension $2$. Its character $\chi$ is rational and one has 
    \[ \rho^{\oplus 2} = \Ind_{C_1}^G \trivial \ominus \Ind_{C_2}^G \trivial, \]
    but one cannot write $\rho$ as a virtual permutation representation ($\chi$ has Schur index $2$ so $\chi \not\in \R_{\bQ}(G)$).  
 \end{example}

%\begin{notn}
%For $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ an irreducible character let 
%\[  \repnorm{\rho} = \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}m(\rho)\cdot \rho^\sigma \quad \in R_{\bQ}(G) , \]
%where $m(\rho) \in \bZ$ is the Schur index of $\rho$.
%\end{notn}
%Then $\repnorm{\rho}$ is the character of an irreducible rational representation. Every irreducible rational representation can be obtained this way. We can extend this map additively to a surjective map $R_{\bC}(G) \to R_{\bQ}(G)$. 

%Let $\overline{R_K(G)}$ be the subring of elements of $R(G)$ which have values in $K$. Then $R_K(G) \subset \overline{R_K(G)}$ and this inclusion is of finite index. 
%Given a character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\bQ(\chi)$ be the smallest subfield of $\bC$ containing $\{ \chi(g) \mid g \in G \}$.
%Let $R_{\bC}(G)$ denote the ring of characters of complex representations of $G$. The number of complex irreducible representations of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. Let $R_{\bQ}(G)$ be the ring of characters of rational valued representations of $G$.
%The number of irreducible $\bQ G$-representations up to isomorphism is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$. %(\cite[$\mathsection 13.1$, Cor. 1]{Serre})
