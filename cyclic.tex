The initial motivation in studying the consequences of Conjecture $4$ is to predict positive rank for families of elliptic curves based on their local data. This could be achieved by ensuring that a certain product of BSD terms is not the norm of a quadratic subfield of the field values of an Artin representation. 

The aim of the the this and following sections is to give a negative answer to the motivation above. That is, we prove that in many cases the product of BSD terms is indeed a norm in every quadratic subfield
