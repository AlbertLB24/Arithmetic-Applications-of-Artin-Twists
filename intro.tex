In this report we study a method proposed in \cite{DEW1} for forcing points of infinite order on elliptic curves over finite extensions $F / \bQ$. 

\subsection*{Notation}
We use the following notation for characters:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
    $R_(G)$ & the representation ring of $G$, \\
    $R_{\bQ}(G)$ & the rational representation ring of $G$, \\
    $\Perm(G)$ & the ring of virtual permutations of $G$, \\
    $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ & the ring of rationally-valued characters of $G$,\\
    $\Irr(G)$ & the set of characters of complex irreducible representations of $G$, \\
    %$\Irr_{\bQ}(G)$ & the set of characters of $\bQ$-irreducible representations of $G$, \\ 
    $\bQ(\rho)$ & the field of character values of a complex character $\rho$ of $G$, \\
    $C(G)$ & the finite abelian group $\Char_{\bQ}(G) / \Perm(G)$, \\ 
    %$m(\rho)$ & the Schur Index of an irreducible complex character $\rho$ over $\bQ(\rho)$, \\
    \\
    $H^{x}$ & $= xHx^{-1}$  for $H \leq G$ a subgroup of a group $G$ and $x \in G$,
\end{tabular}

Given an elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ and a number field $F$, we define

\[ C_{E / F} = \prod_v c_v(E / F) \left| \frac{\omega}{\omega_v^{\min}} \right|_v. \]
The product is taken over the finite places of $F$, $\omega$ is a global minimal differential for $E / \bQ$, and $\omega_v^{\min}$ is a minimal differential at $v$. In terms of minimal discriminants, if $E$ is of the form
\[ y^2 + a_1 x y + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6 \]
with minimal discriminant $\Delta_E$ and $\omega = \frac{dx}{2 y + a_1 x + a_3}$, then
\[ \left| \frac{\omega}{\omega_v^{\min}} \right|_v^{-12} = \left| \frac{\Delta_E}{\Delta_{E, v}^{\min}} \right|_v . \]
