\subsection*{Notation}
We use the following notation for characters:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
    $R_{\bC}(G)$ & the ring of characters of representations of $G$ over $\bC$, \\
    $R_{\bQ}(G)$ & the ring of characters of representations of $G$ over $\bQ$, \\
    $\Irr_\bC(G)$ & the set of characters of complex irreducible representations of $G$, \\
    $\Irr_{\bQ}(G)$ & the set of characters of $\bQ$-irreducible representations of $G$, \\ 
    $\bQ(\rho)$ & the field of character values of a complex character $\rho$, \\
    $m(\rho)$ & the Schur Index of an irreducible complex character $\rho$ over $\bQ(\rho)$, \\
\end{tabular}
