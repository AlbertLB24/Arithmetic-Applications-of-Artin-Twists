The Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture has long been exploited to obtain arithmetical information about elliptic curves. Firstly, it relates the rank of an elliptic curve over a number field to the order of vanishing of its $L$-function $L(E / K, s)$ at $s = 1$. Secondly, and more astonishingly, it relates the leading term of the Taylor series of $L(E / K, s)$ at $s = 1$ to a myriad of quantities associated to $E$;  regulators, Tamagawa numbers, size of torsion subgroup and size of Tate-Shafarevich group, discriminant, periods ... {\color{red} maybe we just put in expression haha}



In this report we study a method proposed in \cite{DEW1} for forcing points of infinite order on elliptic curves over finite extensions $F / \bQ$. 

The main idea is to apply Artin formalism of twisted $L$-functions of elliptic curves to force constraints on the the terms in the BSD quotients.



%Let $E / \bQ$ be an elliptic curve, and consider a finite Galois extension $F / \bQ$ with $G = \Gal(G / \bQ)$. Then $E(F) \otimes_{\bZ} \bQ$ is a $\bQ G$-module, of dimension equal to $\rk E / F$. Therefore 



\subsection*{Notation}
Let $G$ be a finite group. We use the following notation for characters:

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
     $\R(G)$ & the representation ring of $G$ (Definition \ref{rep-ring}), \\
     $\B(G)$ & the Burnside ring of $G$ (Definition \ref{burnside}), \\
    $\R_{\bQ}(G)$ & the rational representation ring of $G$, \\
    $\Perm(G)$ & the ring of virtual permutations of $G$, \\
    $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ & the ring of rationally-valued characters of $G$,\\
    $\Irr(G)$ & the set of characters of complex irreducible representations of $G$, \\
    %$\Irr_{\bQ}(G)$ & the set of characters of $\bQ$-irreducible representations of $G$, \\ 
    $\bQ(\rho)$ & the field of character values of a complex character $\rho$ of $G$, \\
    $\C(G)$ & the finite abelian group $\Char_{\bQ}(G) / \Perm(G)$, \\ 
    %$m(\rho)$ & the Schur Index of an irreducible complex character $\rho$ over $\bQ(\rho)$, \\
    $\repnorm{\rho}$ &  $ = \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ)} \rho^{\sigma}$, where $\rho \in \R(G)$ (Definition \ref{rho-norm}),\\
    $\rho^*$ & the character associated to the dual of the representation associated to $\rho$,
    \\
    $H^{x}$ & $= xHx^{-1}$  for $H \leq G$ a subgroup of a group $G$ and $x \in G$,\\
    $p^*$ & defined for an odd prime $p$. If $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, $p^* = p$. If $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, $p^* = -p$

%Given an elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ and a number field $F$, we define

%\[ C_{E / F} = \prod_v c_v(E / F) \left| \frac{\omega}{\omega_v^{\min}} \right|_v. \]
%The product is taken over the finite places of $F$, $\omega$ is a global minimal differential for $E / \bQ$, and $\omega_v^{\min}$ is a minimal differential at $v$. In terms of minimal discriminants, if $E$ is of the form
%\[ y^2 + a_1 x y + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6 \]
%with minimal discriminant $\Delta_E$ and $\omega = \frac{dx}{2 y + a_1 x + a_3}$, then
%\[ \left| \frac{\omega}{\omega_v^{\min}} \right|_v^{-12} = \left| \frac{\Delta_E}{\Delta_{E, v}^{\min}} \right|_v . \]
