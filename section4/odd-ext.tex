\subsection{Compatibility in odd order extensions}

 Let $E / \bQ$ be an elliptic curve. Let $F / \bQ$ be an extension of \textbf{odd order} with Galois group $G$. Consider a representation $\rho \in R(G)$ and the expression as in theorem \ref{thm_positive_rank}. The $m$ occurring in this expression divides $|G|$, hence is odd. The theorem then states that if the corresponding product of fudge factors $C_{E / \cdot}$ is not a norm from a quadratic subfield $\bQ(\sqrt{D}) \subset \bQ(\rho)$, then $E / F$ must have infinite order. 

 In this section, we show under some restrictions for $E$ that we can never use this test to force positive rank.

\begin{thm}
    Suppose that the primes of additive reduction of $E$ are at worst tamely ramified in $F / \bQ$ (and $\geq 5$). 
    Then for any representation $\rho$ of $G$ and any expression as in theorem \ref{thm_positive_rank}, the corresponding ratio of fudge factors is a norm from any quadratic subfield of $\bQ(\rho)$.
    Equivalently, the function $H \mapsto C(E / F^H)$ is trivial on $\rho$-relations. 
\end{thm}

If $\bQ(\rho) = \bQ$ there is nothing to prove. 
Thus we assume $[\bQ(\rho) \colon \bQ] > 1$. Then this index is even. Indeed, since $G$ has odd order, all its characters are complex, so there is an element $\sigma \in \Aut(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ)$ that acts by complex conjugation (i.e. is of order $2$). Therefore there is a quadratic subfield $\bQ(\sqrt{D}) \subset \bQ(\rho)$. Choose any such quadratic subfield. Replacing $\rho$ by the sum of its conjugates by elements of $ \Gal(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ(\sqrt{d}))$, we may assume that $\bQ(\rho) = \bQ(\sqrt{D})$. Let $\tau$ be the generator of $\Gal(\bQ(\sqrt{D}) / \bQ)$. 

Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $\bQ(\sqrt{D}) \subset \bQ(\zeta_k)$. Then $k$ divides the exponent of $G$, hence is odd.

\vspace{1em}
Let us break up the function $C \colon H \mapsto C(E / F^H)$ into $C = \prod_p  C_p \cdot d_p$ where
        \[ C_p(H) =  C_p(E / F^H) := \prod_{v | p}  c_v(E / F^H) , \qquad d_p(H) = \prod_{v | p} \left|\frac{\omega}{\omega_{v}^{\min}}\right|_v . \]
We will observe later that for each reduction type, $C_p$ and $d_p$ are $D_p$-local functions. 
 
We prove that each $C_p \sim_{\rho} 1$ and $d_p \sim_{\rho} 1$ for all primes $p$. We do this by considering serpately each reduction type. Since we deal with each local factor individually, we may assume that $D_p = I_p$ by theorem \ref{DeqI}. {\color{red} does that include the dv terms???}

\subsubsection*{Good reduction}
If $E / \bQ$ has good reduction at $p$, then it has good reduction at all primes lying above $p$ in subfields of $F$. Then the tamagawa number is always one, as well as $\left|\omega / \omega_{v}^{\min}\right|_v$ for any place $v \mid p$ in an intermediate field. Therefore $C_p$, $d_p \sim_{\rho} 1$.

\subsubsection*{Multiplicative reduction}

If $E / \bQ_p$ has multiplicative reduction, then as in the good reduction case one has $\left|\omega / \omega_{v}^{\min}\right|_v = 1$ for any place $v \mid p$ in an intermediate field. Thus $d_p \sim_{\rho} 1$.
For the Tamagawa numbers, we consider non-split/ split reduction separately.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Non-split multiplicative reduction}}

Let $E / \bQ_p$ have non-split multiplicative reduction. Since $D_p = I_p$, all primes above $p$ have residue degree $1$. Then the reduction at places above $p$ remains non-split in all intermediate subfields.
It follows that 
\[ C_p = (D_p, \alpha) \]
where $\alpha$ is the constant function on $B(D_p)$ with $\alpha \in \{1, 2\}$, depending on $\ord_p(\Delta)$ being even or odd. 
We prove a more general lemma that $D_p$-local constant functions are trivial on $\rho$-relations.

\begin{lemma}\label{const-fns}
Let $G$, $\rho$ be as above. The function $(D_p, \alpha)$ for $\alpha \in \bQ^{\times}$ satisfies $(D_p, \alpha) \sim_{\rho} 1$.  
\end{lemma}   

\begin{proof}
    The function $(D_p, \alpha)$ on $B(G)$ sends $H \leq G$ to $\alpha^{| H \backslash G / D_p|}$. Thus if $\Theta = \sum_i n_i H_i$ is a $\rho$-relation, $(D_p, \alpha)(\Theta) = \alpha^{ \sum_i n_i \cdot | H_i \backslash G / D_p|}$. We show that $\sum_i n_i \cdot | H_i \backslash G / D_p|$ is even. 

    %Since $G$ is odd, each $| H_i \backslash G / D_p|$ is odd. On the other hand, $\rho \oplus \tau(\rho)$ has even dimension. Therefore $\sum_i |n_i|$ is even. 
    One has $\Res_D \Theta = \sum_i n_i \sum_{x \in H_i \backslash G / D} D \cap H^{x^{-1}}$ and the permutation representation $\bC[\Res_D \Theta]$ of $D$ is isomorphic to $\Res_D (\rho \oplus \tau(\rho))$. In particular the dimension of this permutation representation is even. The dimension is $\sum_i n_i \sum_{x \in H_i \backslash G / D} [D \colon D \cap H^{x^{-1}} ]$. Since each $[D \colon D \cap H^{x^{-1}} ]$ is odd, this implies there are an even number of terms in the summation, i.e. that $\sum_i n_i \cdot | H_i \backslash G / D_p|$ is even. 
    
\end{proof}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Split multiplicative reduction}}

Now suppose $E / \bQ_p$ has split multiplicative reduction. The reduction type remains split at all places above $p$ within sub-extensions of $F / \bQ$. Let $\ord_p(\Delta) = n$. Then 
\[ C_v = (D_p, I_p, en). \]
Since the $n$ factor is constant by lemma \ref{const-fns} we have $(D_p, I_p, en) \sim_{\rho} (D_p, I_p, e)$.
This is a $D_p$-local function.
The following result shows that if $\bQ(\Res_{D_p}\rho ) = \bQ$, then $(D_p, I_p, e) \sim_{\rho} 1$.

\begin{lemma}\label{rational-res}
    Let $G, \rho$ be as above, $D_p \leq G$. Let the exponent of $D_p$ be $b$. If $k \nmid b$, then $(D_p, I_p, e) \sim_{\rho} 1$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Note that $\bQ(\Res_{D_p}{\rho}) \subset \bQ(\zeta_b) \cap \bQ(\rho) \subset \bQ(\zeta_b)$. Then $\bQ(\rho) \subset \bQ(\zeta_b) \implies k \mid b$ by minimality of $k$. Thus, if $k \nmid b$, one has $\bQ(\rho) \not\subset \bQ(\zeta_b)$, so $\bQ(\Res_{D_p} \rho) = \bQ$ and $\Res_{D_p} \rho = \tau (\Res_{D_p} \rho)$. 
    
    Let $\Theta$ be a $\rho$-relation. It follows that every rational representation that is a summand of $\bC[\Res_{D_p} \Theta]$ arises with multiplicity two. 
    Thus, there is a $(\Res_{D_p}\rho$)-relation $\Theta ' $ such that $\bC[\Res_{D_p} \Theta] \simeq \bC[2 \Theta']$. Then $\Psi = \Theta - 2 \Theta'$ is a Brauer relation for $D_p$. We have 
    \[(D_p, I_p, e)(\Theta) = (D_p, I_p, e)(\Psi) \cdot (D_p, I_p, e)(2 \Theta') = (D_p, I_p, e)(\Psi)  \cdot ((D_p, I_p, e)(\Theta'))^2 = 1\]
    as a function to $\bQ^{\times} / \bQ^{\times}$. Indeed $(D_p, I_p, e)(\Psi) = 1$ on Brauer relations, as per example \ref{trivial-on-brauer} (noting that $D_p$ is odd). Thus $(D_p, I_p, e) \sim_{\rho} 1$.
\end{proof}

We have $D_p = I_p = P_p \ltimes C_l$, where $P_p \triangleleft I_p$ is wild inertia, and $C_l = I_p / P_p$ is the tame quotient. $C_l$ is a cyclic group, with $l \mid p^f - 1 = p - 1$. By the previous result, it is only of interest to consider decomposition groups $D_p = P_p \ltimes C_l$, with $k \mid p^u l$ for some $u \geq 0$. 

Now, $(D_p, I_p, e)(\Theta)$ is the product of ramification indices at primes above $p$. We separate the $p$-part and tame part of this expression.
Recall that the ramification index of a place $w$ above $p$ corresponding to the double coset $H_i x D_p$ has ramification degree $e_w = \frac{|I_p|}{|H_i \cap I_p^x|} =\frac{|I_p|}{|I_p \cap H^{x^{-1}}|}$.
This is the dimension of the permutation representation $\bC[D_p / D_p \cap H^{x^{-1}}]$.
Let  $D_p \cap H^{x^{-1}} = P' \ltimes C_a$ where $P' \leq P$ and $a | l$. Then the ramification index is $\frac{|P|}{|P'|}\cdot \frac{l}{a}$. 


Consider taking fixed points $$\bC[D_p / D_p \cap H^{x^{-1}}]^{P_p} \simeq \bC[D_p / P_p (D_p \cap H^{x^{-1}})] \simeq \bC[D_p / P_p \ltimes C_a].$$ This permutation representation has dimension $\frac{l}{a}$, so we've killed off the $p$-part. 
Then $$\bC[\Res_{D_p} \Theta]^{P_p} \simeq \left(\Res_{D_p} \rho \oplus \tau(\rho)\right)^{P_p}$$
and we can consider these as representations of $D_p / I_p = C_l$. 
Consider the function $g$ on $B(C_l)$ sending $H$ to $[C_l \colon H]$. 
It follows that $(D_p, D_p, e)(\Theta)$ differs from $g(P_p \cdot \Res_{D_p}\Theta / P_p)$ up to a factor of $p$. 

%$(C_l, C_l, e)$ evaluated at $P_p \cdot \Res_{D_p}\Theta / P_p$ equals $(D_p, D_p, \psi_p)$ evaluated at $\Res_{D_p} \Theta$ modulo squares up to (possibly) a factor of $p$.

Crucially, this factor of $p$ doesn't matter:

\begin{lemma}
    Let $K = \bQ(\sqrt{D})$ be a quadratic field, contained in the minimal cyclotomic field $\bQ(\zeta_k)$ with $k$ odd. Let $k \mid p^u l $, for some $u \geq 0$ and $l$ such that $p \equiv 1 \pmod l$. Then $p$ is the norm of an element from $K^{\times}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Since $k$ is odd, it is clear that $D = \prod_{q | k} q^*$, the product being taken over primes dividing $k$. Note that if $q \not= p$, then since $q \mid l$, we have $p \equiv 1 \pmod l \implies p \equiv 1 \pmod q$. By theorem \ref{p-one-mod-disc},  $p$ is the norm of a principal fractional ideal of $K$. If $K$ is imaginary, then $p$ is the norm of an element of $K$. Else, we invoke theorem \ref{p-norm-elem-1} or theorem \ref{p-norm-elem-2}.
    %We show that $p$ has inertial degree $1$ in the extended genus field $E^{+} = K(\{\sqrt{q^*} \colon q | k \})$ of $K$ ({\color{red} cf. appendix}).
    %If $q \not= p$ then $q \mid l$, so $p \equiv 1 \pmod l$. Therefore $p$ splits in any quadratic subfield of $E^{+}$ of discriminant not divisible by $p$. Else, $p$ ramifies in any quadratic subfield with discriminant divisible by $p$. Thus it is clear that $p$ has inertial degree $1$ in $E^{+}$, hence also in the genus field $E$, and it follows from theorem \ref{p-principal} that $p$ is the norm of a principal ideal.  Else, we invoke theorem \ref{minus-one-norm}.
\end{proof}

Thus, we only need to worry about the tame part of our ramification indices, and the triviality of the function $g$ on $B(C_l)$. If $k \nmid l$, then $\phi = (\Res_{D_p} \rho)^{P_p}$ (viewed as a representation on $D_p / P_p$) has rational character. Therefore, arguing as in lemma \ref{rational-res}, $g \sim_{\phi} 1$ as a function to $\bQ^{\times} / \bQ^{\times 2}$.
Therefore we may assume that $k \mid l$ and that $\phi$ has $\bQ(\phi) = \bQ(\rho) = K$.

\begin{prop}
    Let $k \mid l$, then one has $g \sim_{\phi} 1$.   
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\Psi$ be a $\phi$-relation. One may write $\phi \oplus \tau(\phi) = \bC[\Psi] = \sum_{l' \mid l}{a_{l'}} \chi_{l'}$ where $a_{l'} \in \bZ$ and $\chi_{l'}$ are defined in example \ref{cyclic-relns}. Writing each $\chi_{l'}$ in terms of permutation representations as in the example, one obtains an expression for $\bC[\Psi]$, noting this is exact since cyclic groups have no Brauer relations.

    Evaluating $g$ on $\chi_{l'}$ is trivial unless $l' = q^a$ for some $q$ prime, $a \geq 1$. Indeed, if $l' = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_r^{e_r}$ , with $r \geq 2$ and $e_i \geq 1$, then {\color{red} maybe expand on this}
    \[ \prod_{l'' \mid l'} (l'')^{\mu(l' / l'')} = \prod_{j_1, \ldots j_r \in \{0,1\}^r } \left(p_1^{e_1 - j_1} \cdots p_r^{e_r - j_r}\right)^{\# j_i = 1} = \prod_{i = 1}^r \left(\frac{p_i^{e_i}}{p_i^{e_i - 1}}\right)^{\sum_{ j = 0}^{r - 1} \binom{r-1}{j} (-1)^j} = 1. \]
    On the other hand,
    \[ \prod_{l' \mid q^a} (l')^{\mu(q^a / l')} = q .\]
    
    We claim that $k \nmid l'$ implies $a_{l'}$ is even. The irreducible representations of $C_l$ over $\bQ(\phi)$ are given by the orbits of the complex irreducible characters of $C_l$ acted upon by $H = \Gal (\bQ(\zeta_l) / \bQ(\phi))$. One has $\chi_{l'} = \widetilde{\varphi_{l'}}$ where $\bQ(\varphi_{l'}) = \bQ(\zeta_{l'})$. If $ k \nmid l'$ then $\bQ(\phi) \not\subset \bQ(\zeta_{l'})$, so that $B = \Gal(\bQ(\zeta_l) / \bQ(\zeta_{l'})) \not\leq H$. Then $\bQ(\phi) \cap \bQ(\zeta_{l'}) = \bQ$ so $BH = \Gal(\bQ(\zeta_l) / \bQ)$. Then the orbit of $\varphi_{l'}$ under $H$ is fixed by $BH$, hence is rational. It follows that $\langle \phi, \varphi_{l'} \rangle = \langle \tau(\phi) , \varphi_{l'} \rangle$ so that $a_{l'}$ is even.  

    Thus we can only possibly get something interesting if $k = q$ is a prime. But then $q$ is a norm from $\bQ(\sqrt{q^*})$ by corollary \ref{p-principal}. 
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Additive reduction}

Now suppose that $E / bQ_p$ has additive reduction. In this case, assume that $p \geq 5$ is at worst tamely ramified in $F / \bQ$. This ensures that $D_p = I_p = C_l$ is cyclic, and $l \mid p - 1$.

This time the terms involving the minimal differentials are not trivial. 
Let $n = \ord_p(\Delta_E)$. 
Consider a place $w$ of $F^H$ over $p$ with ramification degree and inertial degree $e_w$, $f_w$ over $\bQ$. Then $\Delta_E$ has valuation $n e_w$ in $F^H$. It follows that $\Delta_{E,w}^{\min}$ has valuation $n e_w - 12 \cdot \floor{e_w n /12}$. Therefore

%\[ \left|\frac{\Delta_{E}}{\Delta_{E, w}^\min} \right|_w = p^{f_w 12 \cdot \floor{e_w n / 12}} \implies 
%       \left|\frac{\omega}{\omega_{w}^\min} \right|_w = p \]

{\color{red} first say something about how dv terms go away }


\noindent\underline{\textit{Potentially multiplicative reduction}}

Suppose that $E / \bQ_p$ has Kodaira type $I_n^*$. For a tamely ramified finite extension $K' / \bQ_p$ with ramification degree $e$, $E / K'$ has Kodaira type $I_{en}^*$ if $e$ is odd, and type $I_{en}$ if $n$ is even. Thus in odd degree extensions the reduction type will stay potentially multiplicative.
One has that $v_{K'}(\Delta_{E / K'}) = e v_p(\Delta) - 12\floor{e / 2}$.

\noindent\underline{\textit{Potentially good reduction}}

\begin{lemma}
    Consider $M / L$ a field extension. Let $E / L$ be an elliptic curve, $v$ a finite place of $L$ and $w$ a finite place of $M$ with $w \mid v$. Let $\omega_v$ and $\omega_w$ be the minimal differentials for $E / L_v$ and $E / M_w$ respectively. 
    
    Then, if $E / K_v$ has potentially good reduction and the residue characteristic is not $3$ or $2$, one has
    
    \[ \left|\frac{\omega_v}{\omega_w} \right|_{w} = q^{\floor{\frac{e_{F / K} \cdot \ord_v(\Delta_{E, v}^{\min})}{12}}}, \]
    where $q$ is the size of the residue field at $w$.
\end{lemma}

We consider $F / \bQ$ with additive potentially good reduction at $p$ . Since $D_p = I_p$, the size of the residue field is $p$ at all intermediate extensions. Let $n = v_p(\Delta)$. Then $n \in \{2,3,4,6,8,9,10\}$.  Consider $(D_p, I_p, \psi_p)$ where $\psi_p(e,f) = p^{\floor{e n / 12}}$. Then $(D_p, I_p, \psi_p) \sim_{\rho} 1$. Indeed, this takes values $1$ or $p$ in $\bQ^{\times} / \bQ^{\times 2}$. But $p \equiv 1 \pmod l$ implies that $p$ is the norm of a principal ideal in $\bQ(\rho)$, and hence the norm of an element, by corollary \ref{p-one-mod-disc} and theorem \ref{minus-one-norm}.

The Tamagawa numbers take a little more work. We use the following description of Tamagawa numbers. %Tim and Vlad reg consts Lemma 3.19

\begin{lemma}
    Let $K' /K / \bQ_p$ be finite extensions and $p \geq 5$. Let $E / K$ be an elliptic curve with additive reduction; 
    \[ E \colon y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B, \]
    with discriminant $\Delta = -16(4 A^3 + 27 B^2)$. Let $\delta = v_K(\Delta)$, and $e = e_{K' / K}$.

    If $E$ has potentially good reduction, then 
        \[
        \begin{array}{l l l l}
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 2 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 1, & \quad (II, II^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 3 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 2, & \quad (III, III^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 4 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = \begin{cases} 1, & \sqrt{B} \notin K'
                                \\ 3, & \sqrt{B} \in K' \end{cases}, & \quad (IV, IV^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 6 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = \begin{cases} 2, & \sqrt{\Delta} \notin K'
                \\ 1 \ \text{or} \ 4, & \sqrt{\Delta} \in K' \end{cases}, & \quad (I_0^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 12 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 1. & \quad (I_0)
        \end{array}
        \]
    Moreover, the extensions $K'(\sqrt{B}) / K'$ and $K'(\sqrt{\Delta}) / K'$ are unramified.
\end{lemma}

So suppose an elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ has additive reduction at $p$, with $p \geq 5$. Then we can write $E \colon y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. Let $D = \Gal(F_{\fp} / \bQ_p)$ be the local Galois group at $p$. Assume that $p$ is totally tamely ramified, so that $D = I = C_n$. Since there is no wild ramification, and $f = 1$, this means that $n \mid p - 1$. We consider the contribution corresponding to an irreducible rational character $\chi_d$ of $D$, given by 
\begin{equation}\label{tam-contrib}
\prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')}.
\end{equation}

Observe that in a totally ramified extension of degree coprime to $12$, the Tamagawa number remains the same. If $(12, d) = 1$, then $(12, d') = 1$ for $d' \mid  d$, so the Tamagawa number is constant across subfields $F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$. Therefore,
\[\prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')} = C(E / \bQ_p)^{\sum_{d' \mid d} \mu(d / d')} = 1,\]
assuming $d > 1$. 

So we only need to worry about when $3 \mid d$. If we have type $III$ or $III^*$ or $I_0^*$ then the Tamagawa number is still unchanged in any totally ramified cyclic extension of degree dividing $d$. We will treat the other cases separately: 

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Type $II$ and $II^*$ reduction:}}

Firstly, suppose that $\delta = 2$, that is we have Type $II$ reduction. If $3 \mid d'$ then $E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ has type $I_0^*$ reduction. The Tamagawa number then depends on whether $\sqrt{\Delta} \in \bQ_p$. Since we have additive reduction, we know that $p \mid A$, $p \mid B$. Moreover, $\delta = 2$ implies that $v_p(B) = 1$. Then, $\Delta = p^2\cdot \alpha$, and $\alpha \equiv -27\cdot\square \pmod p$. Therefore $\sqrt{\Delta} \in \bQ_p \iff -3$ is a square $\pmod p$. But this is the case; we assumed $p \equiv 1 \pmod n$, so $p \equiv 1 \pmod 3$. Therefore the Tamagawa number will be $1$ or $4$, which is a square.
If $3 \nmid d'$ then the reduction type over $ F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ is $II$ or $II^*$. Then the Tamagawa number is $1$. Thus in total, we get a square contribution from (\ref{tam-contrib}).

If $\delta = 10$, then $E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ has reduction type $I_0^*$ whenever $3 \mid d'$. Once more, $v_p(A), v_p(B) \geq 1$, and $v_p(\Delta) = 10 = \min(3 v_p(A), 2 v_p(B))$ {\color{red} maybe this is suss} $\implies v_p(B) = 5$. Therefore we get $\Delta = p^{10} \alpha$ with $\alpha \equiv -27\cdot\square \pmod p$, and we conclude as above.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Type $IV$ and $IV^*$ reduction:}}

Now, if $E /\bQ_p$ has additive reduction of type $IV$ or $IV^*$, it attains good reduction over any totally ramified cyclic extension of degree divisible by $3$. This could result with $3$ coming up an odd number of times in our Tamagawa number product, when $\sqrt{B} \not\in \bQ_p$. 

%We show that for both types, one has $\sqrt{B} \in \bQ_p$. 
%Indeed, if $\delta = 4$, then $v_p(B) = 2$, and $v_p(A) \geq 2$. 
\vspace{1em}
In summary, 
\begin{equation}
    \prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')}
    = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & 3 \nmid d, \\
        1 & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{0, 3, 6, 9\}, \\
        1 \cdot \square & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{2, 10\}, \\
        3^a \cdot\square, a \in \{0,1\} & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{4,8\}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{rem}
   There's no reason why we can't get 3; see elliptic curve 441b1 with additive reduction at $7$ of type IV and Tamagawa number equal to $3$
\end{rem}

However, it turns out we will only get $3$ occurring oddly when $d = 3$. Indeed, one has that $\langle \Ind_{D_{d'}}^D \trivial, \psi_3 \rangle = 1$ if $3 \mid d'$, and $0$ if $3 \nmid d'$, where $\psi_3$ is an irreducible character of $D$ of order $3$. Therefore one sees that the number of places with ramification degree divisible by $3$ cancels unless $d = 3$. Indeed, $\langle \chi_d , \psi_3 \rangle = 0$ unless $d = 3$, 
in which case it is $1$. Therefore (\ref{tam-contrib}) can only be non-square when $d = 3$. {\color{red} then conclude why this is fine}
