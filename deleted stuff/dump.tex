Consider $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$ with odd order, and $E / \bQ$ an elliptic curve with good reduction at wildly ramified primes in $F / \bQ$. Consider a relation of the form
\begin{equation}\label{reln} 
    \Theta = \sum_i n_i \Ind_{H_i}^G \trivial \simeq \rho \oplus \tau(\rho),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is a character of $G$ with $\Gal(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ) = \langle \tau \rangle $ of size $2$. Let $m$ denote the minimal positive integer such that $\bQ(\rho) \subset \bQ(\zeta_m)$. The sum on the left is over subgroups $H_i \leq G$. 

Observe that $\Res_D\rho$, where $D$ is a decomposition group of exponent $n$, is rationally-valued when $m \nmid n$. In the context of norm relations, if $\Res_D\rho = \Res_D\tau(\rho)$, then we always get squares. Thus the interesting case is when $m \mid n$. 

We understand $\Res_D$ best when $D$ is cyclic. Let $D = C_n$ with $m \mid n$. Applying $\Res_D$ to (\ref{reln}), we get
\begin{equation}\label{reln-resD}
\sum_i n_i \sum_{x \in H_i \backslash G / D} \Ind_{D \cap x^{-1}H_i x}^D \trivial \simeq \Res_D \rho \oplus \tau(\Res_D \rho).
\end{equation}

Since both sides are now rationally valued, we can write this as $\sum_{d \mid n} a_d \cdot \chi_d$ where $a_d \in \bZ$ and $\chi_d$ are defined in example \ref{cyclic-relns}. Writing each $\chi_d$ in terms of permutation representations as in the example, one obtains an expression for the LHS of (\ref{reln}) (since cyclic groups have no Brauer relations, this is on the nose).
Therefore, if $\psi(\Theta) = \prod_p \psi(\Res_{D_p} \Theta)$, we have $\psi(\Res_{D_p} \Theta) = \prod_{d \mid n} \psi(\chi_d)^{a_d}$ whenever $D_p = C_n$.

As such, we'd like to be able to reduce to cyclic decomposition groups. As we only assume bad reduction at tamely ramified primes in $F / \bQ$, one has that $I$ is cyclic. 
It turns out that we may assume that $D = I$ when $[D \colon I]$ is odd. 

\begin{thm}
    Let $F / \bQ$ be a Galois extension of odd degree, with $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. 
    Consider a semistable elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ with good reduction at primes that are wildly ramified in $F / \bQ$.
    
    Then, for any $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ with $[\bQ(\rho)\colon \bQ] > 1$, the function $f \colon B(G) \to
    \bQ^{\times} / N_{\bQ(\rho) / \bQ}(\bQ(\rho)^{\times})$ sending $H \mapsto C(E / F^{H})$ satisfies $f \sim_{\rho} 1$.
\end{thm}
