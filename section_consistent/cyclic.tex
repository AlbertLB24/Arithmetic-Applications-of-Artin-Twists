\subsection{Cyclic Extensions}

The aim of this subsection is to give a complete analysis of the case when $F$ is a cyclic extension of $\QQ$. We show that for most $d\geq 2$ and representations $\rho$ of $C_d$, the product \eqref{eqn_localprod} of local factors is the norm of any quadratic subfield of $\QQ(\rho)$. We also provide an exhaustive list of cases when the product may not be a norm of quadratic subfield of $\QQ(\rho)$. Firstly, we recall the following result, whose proof was covered in Example \ref{cyclic-relns}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_relation}
    Let $\rho$ be a representation of the cyclic group $C_d$. Then there is one unique relation $\Theta_\rho\in B(C_d)$ such that 
    $$\CC[C_d/\Theta_{\rho}]=\repnorm{\rho}=\bigoplus_{\fg\in\Gal(\QQ(\rho)/\QQ)}\rho^{\fg}.$$
    In particular, if $\rho=\psi_d$ is a faithful character of $C_d$, then
    $$\Theta_{\psi_d}=\sum_{k\mid d}\mu(k)C_k.$$
\end{lemma}


We also the following definition that characterises those $d$ that always give norms of the quadratic subfields and those that do not. Recall that given some integer $d\geq 2$, $\rad(d)=\prod_{p\mid d}p$ is the smallest squarefree integer dividing $d$.

\begin{defn}
    Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer. We say that $d$ is \textbf{bad} if either $\rad(d)=2$ or $\rad(d)=6$ and $4\mid d$. Otherwise, we say that $d$ is \textbf{good}.
\end{defn}

The main result of this section is to prove that for good $d$ and any representation $\rho$ od $d$, the product of local factors always gives a norm of any quadratic subfield of $\QQ(\rho)$.

\begin{thm}\label{thm_consistent_cyclic}
    Let $d\geq2$ be a good positive integer and let $F/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields such that $\Gal(F/K)=C_d$. Let $\rho$ be a representation of $C_d$ and let $\Theta_\rho\in B(C_d)$ be such that
    $$\CC[G/\Theta_\rho]=\repnorm{\rho}.$$

    If $E/\QQ$ is a semistable elliptic curve at $2$ and $3$, then for any $\QQ(\sqrt{D})\subseteq\QQ(\rho)$,
    $$C(\Theta_\rho)\in N_{\QQ(\sqrt{D})/\QQ}(\QQ(\sqrt{D})^{\times}).$$
\end{thm}

The first step towards proving this theorem is to show that if the theorem holds for faithful characters, then it holds for arbitrary representations. 

\begin{lemma}
    Suppose that Theorem \ref{thm_consistent_cyclic} holds for faithful characters $\psi_d$. Then it also holds for any representation $\rho$ of $C_d$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Firstly, we show that the theorem also holds for arbitrary characters of $C_d$. Let $\psi_{d'}$ be a character of $C_d$ of order $d'$ for some $d'\mid d$, and recall that 
    $$\Theta_{\psi_{d'}}=\sum_{k\mid d'}\mu(k)C_{dk/d'}.$$ Since $\ker\psi_k=C_{d/k}$, we can view $\psi_k$ as a faithful character of $C_k$. Then the result follows immediately from the theorem applied to $k$ and the $C_k$-extension $F/F^{C_{d/k}}$.
    Now assume that $\rho$ is any representation of $C_d$. Then $\repnorm{\rho}$ is a rational valued representation, and the representations
    $$\chi_k:=\repnorm{\psi_k}$$
    for each $k\mid d$ are a basis of the rational representations. Hence, there is a unique decomposition
    $$\repnorm{\rho}=\sum_{k\mid d}a_k\chi_k,\ a_k\in\ZZ,$$
    where
    which in particular implies that 
    $$C(\Theta_\rho)=\prod_{k\mid d}C(\Theta_{\psi_k})^{a_k}\equiv \prod_{\substack{k\mid d \\ a_k\text{ odd}} }C(\Theta_{\psi_k})^{a_k}\pmod{\QQss}.$$
    In Proposition \ref{index-fn-trivial} we showed that if $\QQ(\rho)\nsubseteq \QQ(\zeta_d)=\QQ(\psi_k)$, then $a_k$ was even, so if $a_k$ is odd, then $\QQ(\rho)\subseteq\QQ(\zeta_k)$. If $\QQ(\sqrt{D})$ is a quadratic subfield of $\QQ(\rho)$, then $C(\Theta_{\psi_k})$ is a norm from $\QQ(\sqrt{D})$ whenever $a_k$ is odd. This implies that $C(\Theta_\rho)$ is a norm from $\QQ(\sqrt{D})$ too, and thus Theorem \ref{thm_consistent_cyclic} holds.
\end{proof}

This lemma has the great advantage that it allows us to restrict our attention to faithful characters of $C_d$. To simplify notatation, we will denote $\Theta_d=\sum_{k\mid d}\mu(k)C_k\in B(C_d)$ as the $\psi_d$-relation, where $\psi_d$ is a faithful character of $C_d$.

\begin{rem}\label{rem_radical}
    Lemma \ref{lem_relation} has an important consequence. Given an integer $d\geq2$, note that a subgroup $C_k$ appears in $\Theta_d$ if and only if $C_k\leq C_{\rad(d)}$. Consequently, in terms of fields, if $L_k=F^{C_{d/k}}$ is the unique intermediate field with $[L_k:\QQ]=k$ for each $k\mid d$, then $C(\Theta_d)$ contains the local factors of $L_k$ if and only if $L_{d/\rad(d)}\subseteq L_k\subseteq F$.

    Following this observation, we will compute $T(\Theta_d)$ and $D(\Theta_d)$ by computing locally $\Tp(\Theta_d)$ and $\Tp(\Theta_d)$ for each prime $\pp$ of some conveniently chosen subfield $L_k\subseteq L_{d/\rad(d)}$, and then combinining this local information via the formula
    \begin{equation}\label{eqn_local_contr}
        T(\Theta_d)=\prod_{\pp}\Tp(\Theta_d)=\prod_\pp\left(\prod_{k\mid d} \Tp(C_k)^{\mu(k)}\right),    
    \end{equation}
    and where the same equation holds for $D(\Theta_d)$.
\end{rem}



We divide the proof of Theorem \ref{thm_consistent_cyclic} for faithful characters into two separate cases: odd and even cyclic extensions. The main idea in both cases is to simplify the general case into smaller cases where we can directly compute $\Cp(\Theta_d)$ for each finite place $\pp$ of $K$. Unless stated otherwise, we assume thoughout that $$\Theta_d=\sum_{k\mid d}\mu(k)C_k\in B(C_d).$$
