As we discussed in the previous section, our motivation is to use Theorem \ref*{thm_positive_rank} to predict points of infinite order for families of elliptic curves. However, in this section we prove that in several cases the theorem will never make such a prediction. In other words, in such cases, the product 
$$\frac{\prod_i C_{E/F_i}}{\prod_j C_{E/F_j'}}$$ 
is always a norm for every subfield $\QQ(\sqrt{D})\subseteq\QQ(\rho)$. Before we give the precise statements, we give a proof of some important results that will be used throughout. The first one discussed the quadratic subfields of certain cyclotomic extensions.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_subfields}
    Let $p$ be a rational prime, $n$ a positive integer and let $p^*=(-1)^{(p-1)/2}p$. Then the following holds.

        %                                     \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Firstly, we remark that the discrimant of the field $\QQ(\sqrt{D})$, with $D$ squarefree is
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta(\QQ(\sqrt{D}))=
        \begin{cases}
            D \ \quad\text{  if } D\equiv1\pmod{4},\\
            4D \quad\text{ if } D\equiv2,3\pmod{4}.
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    In addition, we also recall that $\QQ(\zeta_N)/\QQ$ is a Galois extension with $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_N)/\QQ)=(\ZZ/N\ZZ)^*$ and that a rational prime $q$ ramifies in $\QQ(\zeta_N)/\QQ$ if and only if $q\mid N$. The result follows by combining these two properties with the Galois correspondence, as we show now.

    If $p$ is odd, then $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{p^n})/\QQ)=(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ)^*=C_{p^{n-1}(p-1)}$ is a cyclic group of even order, and therefore $\QQ(\zeta_{p^n})$ has one unique quadratic subfield, which can only ramifiy at $p$. If $p\equiv1\pmod{4}$, then the only such field is $\QQ(\sqrt{p})$ and if $p\equiv3\pmod{4}$ the only such field is $\QQ(\sqrt{-p})$. This proves the first row. 

    Since $\QQ(\zeta_2)=\QQ$ and $\QQ(\zeta_4)=\QQ(i)$, the second and third row are immediate. For $m\geq3$, $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{2^m})/\QQ)=(\ZZ/2^m\ZZ)^*=C_2\times C_2^{m-2}$ and therefore $\QQ(\zeta_{2^m})$ has three quadratic subfields that can only ramify at $2$. Again, it is easy to check that the only such fields are $\QQ(i)$, $\QQ(\sqrt{2})$ and $\QQ(\sqrt{-2})$, as desired. Alternatively, one can also show that $\zeta_8=(1+i)/\sqrt{2}$, which also implies the result. This proves the third row.

    The remaining rows are essentially a combination of the results we have already shown. We note that $\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{2p^n})/\QQ)=(\ZZ/2p^n\ZZ)^*$ is cyclic while $$\Gal(\QQ(\zeta_{2^mp^n})/\QQ)=(\ZZ/2^mp^n\ZZ)^*=(\ZZ/2^m)^*\times(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ)^*=C_2\times C_{2^{m-2}}\times C_{p^{n-1}(p-1)}.$$
    Hence, $\QQ(\zeta_{2^mp^n})$ has one unique quadratic subfield if $m=1$ which must be $\QQ(\sqrt{p^*})$, three quadratic subfields if $m=2$ which are $\QQ(i),\QQ(\sqrt{p}),\QQ(\sqrt{-p})$ and seven quadratic fields if $m=3$. In the latter case, we know that $i,\sqrt{p^*},\sqrt{2}\in\QQ(\zeta_{2^mp^n})$ and therefore the seven fields must be the ones listed in the table.

\end{proof}

The second result gives a necessary condition on primes ramifying in finite extensions. The result is naturally phrased in terms of local fields.

\begin{prop}\label{prop_totally_ramified}
    Let $F/\QQ_p$ be a finite extension with residue field $\kappa$. Then there exists a tame, totally ramified cyclic extension $F_n$ of degree $n$ over $F$ if and only if $n\mid|\kappa^*|$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Assume first that $n\mid|\kappa^*|$. Let $\pi$ be a normalizer of $F$ and consider $F_n=F(\pi^{1/n})$. We claim that $F_n$ satisfies the desired properties. Since $n\mid|\kappa^*|$, $\kappa$ contains all $n$-th roots of unity and therefore the polynomial $x^n-1$ factors into linear terms in $\kappa[x]$. The divisibility condition above implies $\Char\kappa\nmid n$ and hence by Hensel's Lemma $x^n-1$ also factors into linear terms in $F[x]$. In other words, $\QQ_p(\zeta_n)\subseteq F$ and therefore $F_n$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $x^n-\pi$. This shows that $F_n/F$ is a tame, toally ramified Galois extension, and the map 
    \begin{align*}
        \psi: \Gal(F_n/F)&\longrightarrow \mu_n\cong C_n\\
        \sigma &\longmapsto \frac{\sigma(\pi^{1/n})}{\pi^{1/n}}
    \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism of groups, which proves that the extension is cyclic of degree $n$.

    Conversely, suppose that $F_n/F$ is a tame, totally ramified cyclic extension of degree $n$. An important result shows that there is some uniformizer $\pi$ of $F$ such that $F_n=F(\pi^{1/n})$. The polynomial $x^n-\pi$ is Einstein over $F$, and therefore irreducible over $F$. Since $F_n/F$ is assumed to be Galois, all roots of $x^n-\pi$ lie in $F_n$. In particular, $\QQ(\zeta_n)\subseteq F_n$. Since $\Char\kappa\nmid n$, it follows that $\kappa$ also contains all $n$-th roots of unity, proving that $n\nmid|\kappa^*|$ as desired. 
\end{proof}
