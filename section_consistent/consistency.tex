As we discussed in the previous section, our motivation is to use Theorem \ref*{thm_positive_rank} to predict points of infinite order for families of elliptic curves. However, in this section we prove that in several cases the theorem will never make such a prediction. In other words, in such cases, the product 
$$\frac{\prod_i C_{E/F_i}}{\prod_j C_{E/F_j'}}$$ 
is always a norm for every subfield $\QQ(\sqrt{D})\subseteq\QQ(\rho)$.
