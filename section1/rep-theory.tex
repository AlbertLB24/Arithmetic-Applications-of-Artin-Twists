As observed in the introduction, it can be useful to apply the theory of representations of finite groups to the study of elliptic curves over finite Galois extensions. This section introduces some representation-theoretic concepts that we will apply in later sections. 

Given a finite extension $F / \bQ$ with $G = \ \Gal(F / \bQ)$, one may be interested in functions defined on subfields of $F / \bQ$, equivalently on subgroups of $G$. Since subgroups up to conjugacy correspond to subfields up to isomorphism, many functions one may consider are constant on conjugacy classes of subgroups. 

In the first part, we recall some rational representation theory. Then we define the Burnside ring{\color{red} \ldots}

In the third part we introduce... as well as $D$-local functions, borrowing definitions that appear in \cite[Section 2.iii]{reg-const}.

\subsection{Rational characters and permutation representations}\label{rep}

Let $G$ be a finite group, $K$ a field of characteristic zero. Recall that a \textbf{representation} of $G$ over $K$ is a group homomorphism $\rho \colon G \to \GL(V)$ where $V$ is a $K$-vector space. Associated to a representation $\rho$ is a \textbf{character} $\chi \colon G \to K^{\times}$, defined by letting $\chi(g) = \Tr \rho(g)$ for $g \in G$. For complex representations, $\rho$ is determined by its character; if $\rho$, $\rho'$ are representations with identical characters, then $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are isomorphic as representations. 

\begin{defn}\label{rep-ring}
Let $\chi_1, \ldots \chi_h$ be the distinct characters of the complex irreducible representations of $G$. 
Then the \textbf{representation ring} of $G$ is 
\[ \R(G) = \bZ \chi_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \bZ \chi_h .\]
%We can also view this as the Grothendieck group of the category of finitely generated $\bC[G]$-modules.
\end{defn}

Since we take differences of characters in $\R(G)$, we call elements of $\R(G)$ \textbf{virtual representations}. 

Let $K$ be a number field. Denote by $\R_K(G)$ the group generated by characters of the representations of $G$ over $K$. This is a subring of $\R(G)$.
When $K = \bQ$ this is called the \textbf{rational representation ring}.
The characters of the distinct irreducible representations of $G$ over $K$ form an orthogonal basis of $\R_K(G)$ (\cite[Proposition 32]{Serre}).
Let $m$ be the exponent of $G$. If $K$ contains the $m$-th roots of unity, then $\R_K(G) = \R(G)$ (\cite[Theorem 24]{Serre}). This implies every representation of $G$ can be realized over such $K$. 
\vspace{1em}

%The rank of $R_K(G)$ is discussed in {\color{red} Serre 12.4}.
Let $\Perm(G)$ be the ring of virtual permutation representations of $G$ (i.e. the ring generated by the characters of $\bC[G / H] = \Ind_{H}^G \trivial$ for $H \leq G$). Let $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ be the ring of rationally valued characters of $G$. Then we have inclusions 
\[ \Perm(G) \to \R_{\bQ}(G) \to \Char_{\bQ}(G). \]
Each of these groups have equal $\bZ$-rank, equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$ {\color{red} ref}. Moreover the cokerenels of these maps are finite {\color{red} ref}.

\begin{defn}\label{rho-norm}
    Let $\rho \in \R(G)$. We define the norm of $\rho$, denoted $\repnorm{\rho}$, by 
    \[
    \repnorm{\rho} \defeq \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}  \rho^\sigma \quad \in \Char_{\bQ}(G),
    \]
    where $\bQ(\rho)$ is the smallest Galois field extension that contains $ \{\rho(g) \colon g \in G \}$ , and $\rho^\sigma$ is the character such that $\rho^\sigma(g) = \sigma(\rho(g))$.
\end{defn}

It's clear that $\Char_{\bQ}(G)$ is generated by $\{ \repnorm{\rho} \colon \rho \in \Irr(G) \}$. Indeed, if a representation has a rationally valued character, then any complex irreducible constituent must occur along with all its Galois conjugates with equal multiplicity.

Note that this is not additive, i.e. one does not have \[\repnorm{\rho + \tau} = \repnorm{\rho} + \repnorm{\tau}. \]  

\begin{example}
    Let $G = C_p$ and $\psi_p$ a character of order $p$. Then $\bQ(\psi_p) = \bQ(\zeta_p)$ and $\repnorm{\psi_p}$ is the sum over the $p - 1$ non-trivial characters of $G$. But $\repnorm{\psi_p + \trivial} = \trivial^{\oplus (p - 1)} + \repnorm{\psi_p} \not= \repnorm{\trivial} + \repnorm{\psi_p}$.
\end{example}

%Conversely,  Therefore our map $R(G) \to \Char_{\bQ}(G)$ is surjective.

%Such a character may not be in $R_{\bQ}(G)$, however. That is, it has rational character, but the corresponding representation cannot be realized over $\bQ$. The quotient $\Char_{\bQ}(G) / R_{\bQ}(G)$ is the study of Schur indices.  If $\rho \in R(G)$ is an irreducible representation, the \textbf{Schur index} is the smallest integer $m(\rho)$ such that 
%\[ \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}m(\rho) \cdot \rho^\sigma \quad \in R_{\bQ}(G). \]

The group $$\C(G) \defeq \frac{\Char_{\bQ}(G)}{\Perm(G)}$$ is a finite abelian group, of exponent dividing $|G|$ (this follows from Artin's induction theorem {\color{red} ref}). The study of this group is quite subtle, see for example \cite{Tim-Alex}. For us, it's enough to know that there exists a minimum integer $m$ dividing $|G|$ such that $\repnorm{\rho}^{\ \oplus m } \in \Perm(G)$, where $m$ is the order of $\repnorm{\rho}$ in $\C(G)$. 
%Thus, we have a map $\Irr(G) \to \Perm(G)$. We extend this additively to a map $R(G) \to \Perm(G)$.
\begin{example}
If $G = C_n$ then $\C(G)$ is trivial (see Example \ref{cyclic-relns}). $\C(G)$ is also trivial for the symmetric groups $G = S_n$. 
\end{example}

 \begin{example}
    $G = Q_8$, the quaternion group, has $\C(G) = \bZ / 2 \bZ$. The faithful character $\chi$ of $Q_8$ has rational character and 
    \[ \chi^{\oplus 2} = \Ind_{C_1}^G \trivial \ominus \Ind_{C_2}^G \trivial, \]
    but one cannot write $\chi$ as a virtual permutation representation ($\chi$ has Schur index $2$ so $\chi \not\in \R_{\bQ}(G)$).  
 \end{example}

%\begin{notn}
%For $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ an irreducible character let 
%\[  \repnorm{\rho} = \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}m(\rho)\cdot \rho^\sigma \quad \in R_{\bQ}(G) , \]
%where $m(\rho) \in \bZ$ is the Schur index of $\rho$.
%\end{notn}
%Then $\repnorm{\rho}$ is the character of an irreducible rational representation. Every irreducible rational representation can be obtained this way. We can extend this map additively to a surjective map $R_{\bC}(G) \to R_{\bQ}(G)$. 

%Let $\overline{R_K(G)}$ be the subring of elements of $R(G)$ which have values in $K$. Then $R_K(G) \subset \overline{R_K(G)}$ and this inclusion is of finite index. 
%Given a character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\bQ(\chi)$ be the smallest subfield of $\bC$ containing $\{ \chi(g) \mid g \in G \}$.
%Let $R_{\bC}(G)$ denote the ring of characters of complex representations of $G$. The number of complex irreducible representations of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. Let $R_{\bQ}(G)$ be the ring of characters of rational valued representations of $G$.
%The number of irreducible $\bQ G$-representations up to isomorphism is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$. %(\cite[$\mathsection 13.1$, Cor. 1]{Serre})
