At this point, we aim to study the arithmetic applications of Conjecture \ref{conj_4}. Some of these applications have already been studied in \cite[\S 3]{DEW1}. For example, the conjecture allows one to predict non-trivial interplay of the primary parts of the Tate-Shafarevich group of families of elliptic curves, non-trivial Selmer groups, and even positive rank. Interestingly, some of these results appear not to be tractable with other common current methods.
%In later sections, we will aim to show that the product of local factors is indeed a norm in quadratic subextension of the field of values, and the following notation, which expands on Notation \ref{not_contr} will be useful.

%\begin{notation} \label{not_total_contr}
%    Let $F$, $\rho$, $m$ and the fields $F_i,F'_j$ be as in Theorem \ref{thm_positive_rank}. Let $K$ be a subfield of $F$ and $\pp$ a prime of $K$. Then we define
%    $$\contr_\rho(\pp)=\frac{\prod'_i C_{\pp\mid p}(F_i)}{\prod'_j C_{\pp\mid p}(F'_j)},$$
%    where the restricted product is taken over all $F_i$ and $F'_j$ containing $K$.
%    We remark that 
%    $$\frac{\prod'_i C_{E/F_i}}{\prod'_j C_{E/F'_j}}=\prod_p\contr_\rho(p)$$
%    where the product runs over all rational primes. Our strategy is to calculate all $\contr_\rho(p)$ locally first, to then multiply them together. We recall once again that if $p$ is a prime of good reduction of the elliptic curve, then $\contr_\rho(p)=1$, so we will only care about the primes of bad reduction.
%\end{notation}

%{\color{red} If $\Theta$ is the relation in $B(G)$ corresponding to our subfields $F_i$ and $F_j'$, then this is just the same as breaking $C(\Theta)$ into $\prod_p C_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta)$... so is this necessary to introduce?}
