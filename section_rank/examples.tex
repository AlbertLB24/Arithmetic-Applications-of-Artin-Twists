\subsection{Examples}

We now present some examples where we use Theorem \ref{thm_positive_rank} to force positive rank. Throughout we will consider an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\bQ$, and a finite Galois extension $F / \bQ$ with Galois group $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. As described in Remark \ref{rephrase-thm}, the strategy is to find a representation $\rho$ of $G$ and a $\rho$-relation $\Theta \in \B(G)$ such that $C(\Theta)$ is either not a norm from a quadratic subfield of $\bQ(\rho)$, or not a rational square, as appropriate. We start with a small observation:

\begin{rem}[Taking quotients]
    Let $E$, $F$, $G$ be as above. Consider $H \leq G$, and $N \triangleleft G$ such that $N \leq H$. Then $C(H) = C_{E / F^H}$ is equal to $C(NH/N) = C_{E / L^{NH/N}}$ (viewing $C$ as a function on $\B(G / N)$) as the fields $F^H$ and $L^{NH/ N}$ are isomorphic. 
    
    Consider a representation $\rho$ of $G$ with $N \leq \ker \rho$, so that $\bQ(\rho) = \bQ(\rho^N)$. Then, if $\Theta = \sum_i n_i H_i \in \B(G)$ with $N \leq H_i$ for all $i$, it follows that $N \cdot \Theta / N = \Theta / N$ being a norm relation for $C \colon \B(G / N) \to \bQ^{\times}$ implies that $\Theta$ is a norm relation for $C \colon \B(G) \to \bQ^{\times}$. 
\end{rem}

We will need to be able to count primes and compute residue degrees in intermediate extensions of $F / \bQ$, which is described by the following. 

\begin{exercise}[Counting primes and ramification degrees]
Consider a prime $p \in \bQ$ and decomposition and inertia groups $D_p$, $I_p \leq G$. Let $H \leq G$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The number of primes above $p$ in $F^H$ is given by the number of orbits of $D_p$ on $H \backslash G$, where $D_p$ acts by $d(Hg) = H g d^{-1}$ for $d \in D_p$. Equivalently it is $|H \backslash G / D_p|$.
    \item The inertia degree of a prime $\fP$ above $p$ in $F^H$ is the size of the $I_p$ sub-orbits on $H \backslash G$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

    There is a Brauer relation coming from the $C_2 \times C_2$-quotient, given by $$\Psi = C_3 - C_6^a - C_6^b - C_6^c + 2G.$$ Consider an order $6$ character $\rho_a$ of $G$ with $C_2^{a}$ in its kernel. This has $\bQ(\rho_a) = \bQ(\zeta_6) = \bQ(\zeta_3) = \bQ(\sqrt{-3})$. Then $$\Theta = C_2^{a} - C_6^{a} - C_2^{2} + G$$ is a $\rho_a$-relation, with $\bC[ G / \Theta] = \repnorm{\rho_a}$. 

    Let $E / \bQ$ be a semistable elliptic curve and $F / \bQ$ an abelian extension with $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. We claim that $C(\Theta) \in \fieldnorm{\rho_a}$, for all such $E$. Since each subgroup in $\Theta$ contains $C_2^{a}$, we have that $C(\Theta)$ equals $C(\Theta / C_2^{a})$ where $\Theta / C_2^{a} \in \B(G / C_2^{a}) = \B(C_6)$.  Now $\Theta / C_2^{a}$ is a $\chi_6$-relation, where $\chi_6 = \rho_a^{C_2^a}$ is a faithful order $6$ character of $C_6$, with $\bQ(\chi_6) = \bQ(\rho_a)$. But for cyclic groups we always get norm relations; by Theorem \ref{thm_consistent_cyclic}, $C(\Theta / C_2^{a}) \in \fieldnorm{\rho_a}$.

    On the other hand, $C(\Theta + \Psi) = C(\Theta)C(\Psi)$ is not always a norm. Indeed suppose $E / \bQ$ has split multiplicative reduction at a prime $p$ with $D_p = G$, $I_p = C_6^b$ (assuming tamely ramified, one can take a prime $p$ such that $6 \mid p^2 - 1$, e.g. $p = 5$). Let $\ord_p(\Delta_E) = n$. Then there is only one prime above $p$ in each subfield, and the Tamagawa number at a prime $\fP$ above $p$ in $F^H$ is given by $c_{\fP}(E / F^H) = e_{\fP / p} n$. Suppose $E$ has good reduction at all other primes ({\color{red} or be more lenient}).
     Then 
        $$C(\Theta) = \frac{(6n)(n)}{(2n) (3n)} = 1, \qquad
            C(\Psi) = \frac{(2n)(n)^2}{(2n)(n)(2n)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \square.$$
    Thus $C(\Theta + \Psi) = \frac{1}{2} \mod \bQ^{\times 2}$, but $2$ is not a norm in $\bQ(\sqrt{-3})$. Hence one must have $\rk E / F > 0$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Dihedral]
    Let $q_1$, $q_2$ be odd primes. Consider $G = D_{2 q_1 q_2}$ the dihedral group of order $2 q_1 q_2$. There is an irreducible representation $\rho$ of $G$, obtained by inducing a linear order $q_1 q_2$ faithful representation from $C_{q_1 q_2}$. Thus $\rho$ is of degree $2$ and $\bQ(\rho) = \bQ(\zeta_{q_1 q_2})^{C_2}$. Then $\rho$ has $\frac{(q_1 - 1)(q_2 - 1)}{2}$ Galois conjugates, and so $\repnorm{\rho}$ is of dimension $2 \cdot \frac{(q_1 - 1)(q_2 - 1)}{2}$. There is a $\rho$-relation $$\Theta = C_2 - D_{2 q_1} - D_{2 q_2} + G, \qquad \bC[G / \Theta] \simeq \repnorm{\rho}.$$ 

    Suppose that $E / \bQ$ is semistable. Recall that $C(\Theta) = \prod_p T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta)$, where $T_{\fP \mid p}$ depends on $D_p$, $I_p$, the decomposition group and inertia group at $p$ respectively. Suppose that $E / \bQ_p$ has split multiplicative reduction. Ranging over all possible $D_p$ and $I_p$, a case by case analysis yields that $T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta)$ is non-square only when the decomposition group is $D_{2 q_1}$ or $D_{2 q_2}$ (and $I_p$ is non-trivial). 

    For example, let $p$ have decomposition group $D_{2 q_1}$ and inertia group $C_{q_1}$.
        \begin{itemize}[--]
            \setlength\itemsep{0em}
            \item The action of $D_{2 q_1}$ on $C_2 \backslash G$ yields $1$ orbit of size $C_{q_1}$ (the orbit of the identity) and $\frac{q_2 - 1}{2}$ orbits of size $2q_1$ (coming from $C_2$ acting faithfully on $C_{q_2}$). The size of the inertia sub-orbits is $q_1$. Hence $T_{\fP \mid p}(C_2) = (q_1 n)^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}}$.
            \item The action of $D_{2 q_1}$ on $D_{2 q_1} \backslash G$ yields the same number of orbits as above, but now the action of $C_{q_1} \leq D_{2 q_1}$ is trivial and the size of the inertia sub-orbits are all $1$, so that $T_{\fP \mid p}(D_{2 q_1}) = n^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}}$.
            \item The action of $D_{2 q_1}$ on $D_{2 q_2} \backslash G$ yields one orbit of size $q_1$, with the inertia sub-orbit also of size $q_1$, hence $T_{\fP \mid p}(D_{2 q_2}) = q_1 n$.
        \end{itemize}
    Hence
    \[ T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta) = \frac{(q_1 n )^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}} (n)}{(n)^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}} (q_1 n)} = q_1^{\frac{q_2 - 1}{2}} .\] 
    By symmetry, taking the decomposition group to be $D_{2 q_2}$ and inertia group $C_{q_2}$, one has 
     $T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta) = q_2^{\frac{q_1 - 1}{2}}$.

    So let $E / \bQ$ have split multiplicative reduction at $p$ with decomposition group $D_{2 q_1}$ and inertia group $I_p = C_{q_1}$, and good reduction at all other primes. Further suppose that $q_1, q_2 \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and that $\legendre{q_1}{q_2} = -1$. Then $\bQ(\sqrt{q_1 q_2}) \subset \bQ(\rho)$ but $T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta) \not\in N_{\bQ(\sqrt{q_1 q_2}) / \bQ}(\bQ(\sqrt{q_1 q_2})^{\times})$. Indeed, one has $T_{\fP \mid p}(\Theta) \equiv q_1 \mod \bQ^{\times 2}$, but $q_1$ is not the norm of an element of $\bQ(\sqrt{q_1 q_2})$, since $z^2 q_1 = x^2 - q_1q_2 y^2$ for $x,y,z \in \bZ$ implies $q_1 = \square \pmod {q_2}$, a contradiction. Thus $\rk E / F > 0$.

    This rank growth is predicted by root number computations also, however. Assume that $F / \bQ$ is totally real. Then $w(E / F^H) = (-1)^{[F^H \colon \bQ] + | H \backslash G / D_p|}$ by Proposition \ref{compute-root}. Thus
    \begin{itemize}[--]
        \setlength\itemsep{0em}
        \item $w(E / \bQ) = (-1)^2 = 1$,
        \item $w(E / F^{C_2}) = (-1)^{q_1 q_2} (-1)^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}} = (-1)^{\frac{q_2 - 1}{2}}$,
        \item $w(E / F^{D_{2 q_1}}) = (-1)^{q_2}(-1)^{1 + \frac{q_2 - 1}{2}} = (-1)^{\frac{q_2 - 1}{2}},$
        \item $w(E / F^{D_{2 q_2}}) = (-1)^{q_1}(-1) = 1$. 
    \end{itemize}
    Therefore we must have $\rk E / F^{C_2}, \rk E / F^{D_{2q_1}} > 0$, so $\rk E / F > 0$. {\color{red} maybe I could add how this suggests we throw in a $q_1$ for the regulators and then everything is fine }
