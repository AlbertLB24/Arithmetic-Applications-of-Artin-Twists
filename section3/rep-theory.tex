\subsection{Representation theory of finite groups}\label{rep}

Let $G$ be a finite group, $K$ a field of characteristic zero. Recall that a \textbf{representation} of $G$ over $K$ is a group homomorphism $\rho \colon G \to \GL(V)$ where $V$ is a $K$-vector space. Associated to a representation $\rho$ is a \textbf{character} $\chi \colon G \to K^{\times}$, defined by letting $\chi(g) = \Tr \rho(g)$ for $g \in G$. For complex represenations, $\rho$ is determined by its character; if $\rho$, $\rho'$ are representations with identical characters, then $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are isomorphic as representations. 

\begin{defn}
Let $\chi_1, \ldots \chi_h$ be the distict characters of the complex irreducible representations of $G$. 
Then the \textbf{representation ring} of $G$ is 
\[ R(G) = \bZ \chi_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \bZ \chi_h .\]
We can also view this as the Grothendieck group of the category of finitely generated $\bC[G]$-modules.
\end{defn}

Let $K$ be a number field. Denote by $R_K(G)$ the group generated by characters of the reprsentations of $G$ over $K$. This is a subring of $R(G)$. The characters of the distinct irreducible representations of $G$ over $K$ form an orthogonal basis of $R_K(G)$ {\color{red}(cf. Serre Proposition 32).}
Let $m$ be the exponent of $G$. If $K$ contains the $m$-th roots of unity, then $R_K(G) = R(G)$. This implies every representation of $G$ can be realized over $K$. ({\color{red} Serre 12.3})

The rank of $R_K(G)$ is discussed in {\color{red} Serre 12.4}. For example, the rank of $R_{\bQ}(G)$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$. 

\begin{notn}
For $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ an irreducible character let 
\[  \widetilde{\rho} = \sum_{\sigma \in \Gal(\bQ(\rho)/\bQ)}m(\rho)\cdot \rho^\sigma \quad \in R_{\bQ}(G) , \]
where $m(\rho) \in \bZ$ is the Schur index of $\rho$.
\end{notn}
Then $\widetilde{\rho}$ is the character of an irreducible rational representation. Every irreducible rational representation can be obtained this way. We can extend this map additively to a surjective map $R_{\bC}(G) \to R_{\bQ}(G)$. 

%Let $\overline{R_K(G)}$ be the subring of elements of $R(G)$ which have values in $K$. Then $R_K(G) \subset \overline{R_K(G)}$ and this inclusion is of finite index. 
%Given a character $\chi$ of $G$, let $\bQ(\chi)$ be the smallest subfield of $\bC$ containing $\{ \chi(g) \mid g \in G \}$.
%Let $R_{\bC}(G)$ denote the ring of characters of complex representations of $G$. The number of complex irreducible representations of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. Let $R_{\bQ}(G)$ be the ring of characters of rational valued representations of $G$.
%The number of irreducible $\bQ G$-representations up to isomorphism is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups of $G$. %(\cite[$\mathsection 13.1$, Cor. 1]{Serre})

\subsection{The Burnside ring and relations}

Let $G$ be a finite group. Recall that there is a bijection between the isomorphism classes of transitive finite $G$-sets and the conjugacy classes of subgroups $H \leq G$, given by sending a transitive $G$-set $X$ to $H = \Stab_{G}(x)$ for some $x \in X$. Then the action of $G$ on $X$ is equivalent to the action of $G$ on $G / H$. 

\begin{defn}
Let $[X]$ denote the isomorphism class of a $G$-set $X$. 
The \textbf{Burnside ring} $B(G)$ is the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of finite $G$-sets, modulo the relations  $[S] + [T] = [S \sqcup T]$. This is a ring; multiplication is given by $[S] \cdot [T] = [S \times T]$. Using the identification of finite $G$-sets with subgroups of $G$, we write elements of $B(G)$ as $\sum_i n_i H_i$ for $n_i \in \bZ$, $H_i \leq G$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{notn}
There is a homomorphism from the Burnside ring to the rational representation ring $R_{\bQ}(G)$ of $G$ given by taking the corresponding permutation representation:
\[ \bC[-] \colon B(G) \to R_{\bQ}(G),  \qquad \Theta = \sum_i n_i H_i \ \mapsto \ \bC[\Theta ] = \sum_i n_i \Ind_{H_i}^G \trivial_{H_i}. \]
\end{notn}
Elements in the kernel of this map are known as \textbf{Brauer relations}. These show instances of non-isomorphic $G$-sets giving rise to isomorphic permutation representations. 

\begin{example}
    {\color{red} $S_3$ example}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Cyclic groups have no Brauer relations. 
\end{example}

We are interested in elements of $B(G)$ with image isomorphic to $\widetilde{\rho}$ for $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$. 
\begin{defn}
We call $\Theta = \sum_i n_i H_i \in B(G)$ a \textbf{$\rho$-relation} if $\bC[\Theta] \simeq \widetilde{\rho}$. 
\end{defn}
There are $\#$(Brauer relations) $+ 1$ such elements $\Theta$. Of course, when $\rho = 0$ these are Brauer relations. 


\begin{example}\label{cyclic-relns}
    Let $G = C_n$. For each $d \mid n$, let $\chi_d = \widetilde{\varphi_d}$, where $\varphi_d$ is an irreducible complex character of $G$ with field of values $\bQ(\zeta_d)$ and kernel of index $d$.
    Then $\{ \chi_d \colon d\mid n \}$ form an orthogonal basis for the irreducible rational-valued representations of $G$. Note that $\Ind_{C_{n/ d}}^G \trivial$ is the direct sum of irreducible complex representations of $G$ contain $C_{n / d}$ in their kernel. Thus, $\Ind_{C_{n/ d}}^G \trivial \simeq \sum_{d' \mid d} \chi_{d'}$. Applying M\"{o}bius inversion, we obtain the \textit{unqiue} $\varphi_d$-relation for each $d \mid n$:
    \[ \chi_d = \sum_{d' \mid d} \mu(d / d') \cdot \Ind_{C_{n/ d}}^G \trivial. \]
    \end{example}

\begin{notn}
    For $D \leq G$, define maps $\Res_D \colon B(G) \to B(D)$ and $\Ind_D \colon B(D) \to B(G)$ by
    \[  \Res_D H = \sum_{x \in H \backslash G / D} D \cap H^{x^{-1}}, \qquad \quad \Ind_D H = H. \]
    These correspond to the reprsentation theory side, where $\Res_D \Ind_{H}^G \trivial = \sum_{x \in H \backslash G / D} \Ind_{D \cap H^{x^{-1}}}^D \trivial$ (Mackey's decomposition), and $\Ind_{D}^G\Ind_{H}^D \trivial = \Ind_{H}^G \trivial$.
\end{notn}
