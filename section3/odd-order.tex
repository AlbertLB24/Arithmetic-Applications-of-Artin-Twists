\subsection{Compatibility in odd order extensions}

Suppose that $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$ has odd order, and $E / \bQ$ an elliptic curve with good reduction at wildly ramified primes in $F / \bQ$. We look at a relation of the form
\begin{equation}\label{reln} 
    \sum_i n_i \Ind_{H_i}^G \trivial \simeq \rho \oplus \tau(\rho),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is a character of $G$ with $\Gal(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ) = \langle \tau \rangle $ of size $2$. In particular we let $m$ denote the minimal positive integer such that $\bQ(\rho) \subset \bQ(\zeta_m)$. The sum on the left is over subgroups $H_i \subseteq G$. 

If I consider $\Res_D(\rho)$ where $D$ is a decomposition group of exponent $k$, then for $\Res_D(\rho)$ to be non-rationally valued, one needs $m \mid k$. Note that in the context of norm relations, if $\Res_D(\rho) = \Res_D(\tau(\rho))$, then we always get squares.

So now suppose that $D = I = C_n$ with $m \mid n$. Applying $\Res_D$ to (\ref{reln}), we get
\begin{equation}\label{reln-resD}
\sum_i n_i \sum_{x \in H_i \backslash G / D} \Ind_{D \cap x^{-1}H_i x}^D \trivial \simeq \Res_D \rho \oplus \tau(\Res_D \rho).
\end{equation}

Since both sides are now rationally valued, we can write this as $\sum_{d \mid n} a_d \cdot \chi_d$ where $a_d \in \bZ$ and $\{ \chi_d \colon d\mid n \}$ form a basis for the irreducible rational-valued representations of $D$. Explicitly, $\chi_d$ is the sum of the Galois conjugates of an irreducible complex character of $D$ with field of values $\bQ(\zeta_d)$ and kernel of index $d$ (which we'll write as $D_d$ ).

We can write each $\chi_d$ in terms of permutation modules:
\begin{equation}\label{chi-d} \chi_d = \sum_{d' \mid d} \mu(d' / d)\Ind_{D_d'}^D \trivial .\end{equation}
Substituting this into  $\sum_{d \mid n} a_d \cdot \chi_d$ gives an expression for the LHS of (\ref{reln}) (since cyclic groups have no Brauer relations, this is on the nose).
In particular, if we have a $D$-local function, we can evaluate it on each $\chi_d$-relation as in (\ref{chi-d}). Then the total expression is the product of these, raised to $a_d$.

Since we understand represntation theory of cyclic groups (wow!), we'd like to be able to reduce to cyclic decomposotion groups. Note that since we only assume bad reduction at tamely ramified primes in $F / \bQ$, one has that $I$ is cyclic. 
It turns out that we may assume that $D = I$ when $[D \colon I]$ is odd. 

\begin{lemma}\label{DeqI}
    In an odd degree unramified extension, Tamagawa numbers change only up to squares. In particular, if $[D \colon I]$ is odd, then $(D, I, \psi) \sim_{\rho} (I, I, \psi)$ for any $\rho$ with $\bQ(\rho)$ even, where $\psi(e,f)$ is the Tamagawa number. 
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Semistable reduction}

In this subsection we work towards proving the following:

\begin{thm}
    Let $F / \bQ$ be a Galois extension of odd degree, with $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. 
    Consider a semistable elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ with good reduction at primes that are wildly ramified in $F / \bQ$.
    
    Then, for any $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ with $[\bQ(\rho)\colon \bQ] > 1$, the function $f \colon B(G) \to
    \bQ^{\times} / N_{\bQ(\rho) / \bQ}(\bQ(\rho)^{\times})$ sending $H \mapsto C(E / F^{H})$ satisfies $f \sim_{\rho} 1$.
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{dv terms in additive reduction}


\subsubsection{Tamagawa numbers in additive reduction}

We use the following description of Tamagawa numbers. %Tim and Vlad reg consts Lemma 3.19

\begin{lemma}
    Let $K' /K / \bQ_p$ be finite extensions and $p \geq 5$. Let $E / K$ be an elliptic curve with addtive reduction; 
    \[ E \colon y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B, \]
    with discriminant $\Delta = -16(4 A^3 + 27 B^2)$. Let $\delta = v_K(\Delta)$, and $e = e_{K' / K}$.

    If $E$ has potentially good reduction, then 
        \[
        \begin{array}{l l l l}
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 2 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 1, & \quad (II, II^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 3 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 2, & \quad (III, III^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 4 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = \begin{cases} 1, & \sqrt{B} \notin K'
                                \\ 3, & \sqrt{B} \in K' \end{cases}, & \quad (IV, IV^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 6 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = \begin{cases} 2, & \sqrt{\Delta} \notin K'
                \\ 1 \ \text{or} \ 4, & \sqrt{\Delta} \in K' \end{cases}, & \quad (I_0^*) \\
            \gcd(\delta e, 12) = 12 & \implies & c_v(E / K') = 1. & \quad (I_0)
        \end{array}
        \]
    Moreover, the extensions $K'(\sqrt{B}) / K'$ and $K'(\sqrt{\Delta}) / K'$ are unramified.
\end{lemma}

So suppose an elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ has additive reduction at $p$, with $p \geq 5$. Then we can write $E \colon y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. Let $D = \Gal(F_{\fp} / \bQ_p)$ be the local Galois group at $p$. Assume that $p$ is totally tamely ramified, so that $D = I = C_n$. Since there is no wild ramification, and $f = 1$, this means that $n \mid p - 1$. We consider the contribution corresponding to an irreducible rational character $\chi_d$ of $D$, given by 
\begin{equation}\label{tam-contrib}
\prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')}.
\end{equation}

Observe that in a totally ramified extension of degree coprime to $12$, the Tamagawa number remains the same. If $(12, d) = 1$, then $(12, d') = 1$ for $d' \mid  d$, so the Tamagawa number is consant accross subfields $F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$. Therefore,
\[\prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')} = C(E / \bQ_p)^{\sum_{d' \mid d} \mu(d / d')} = 1,\]
assuming $d > 1$. 

So we only need to worry about when $3 \mid d$. If we have type $III$ or $III^*$ or $I_0^*$ then the Tamagawa number is still unchanged in any totally ramified cyclic extension of degree dividing $d$. We will treat the other cases seperately: 

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Type $II$ and $II^*$ reduction:}}

Firstly, suppose that $\delta = 2$, that is we have Type $II$ reduction. If $3 \mid d'$ then $E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ has type $I_0^*$ reduction. The Tamagawa number then depends on whether $\sqrt{\Delta} \in \bQ_p$. Since we have additive reduction, we know that $p \mid A$, $p \mid B$. Moreover, $\delta = 2$ implies that $v_p(B) = 1$. Then, $\Delta = p^2\cdot \alpha$, and $\alpha \equiv -27\cdot\square \pmod p$. Therefore $\sqrt{\Delta} \in \bQ_p \iff -3$ is a square $\pmod p$. But this is the case; we assumed $p \equiv 1 \pmod n$, so $p \equiv 1 \pmod 3$. Therefore the Tamagawa number will be $1$ or $4$, which is a square.
If $3 \nmid d'$ then the reduction type over $ F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ is $II$ or $II^*$. Then the Tamagawa number is $1$. Thus in total, we get a square contribution from (\ref{tam-contrib}).

If $\delta = 10$, then $E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}}$ has reduction type $I_0^*$ whenever $3 \mid d'$. Once more, $v_p(A), v_p(B) \geq 1$, and $v_p(\Delta) = 10 = \min(3 v_p(A), 2 v_p(B))$ {\color{red} maybe this is suss} $\implies v_p(B) = 5$. Therefore we get $\Delta = p^{10} \alpha$ with $\alpha \equiv -27\cdot\square \pmod p$, and we conclude as above.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textit{Type $IV$ and $IV^*$ reduction:}}

Now, if $E /\bQ_p$ has additive reduction of type $IV$ or $IV^*$, it attains good reduction over any totally ramified cyclic extension of degree divisible by $3$. This could result with $3$ coming up an odd number of times in our Tamagawa number product, when $\sqrt{B} \not\in \bQ_p$. 

%We show that for both types, one has $\sqrt{B} \in \bQ_p$. 
%Indeed, if $\delta = 4$, then $v_p(B) = 2$, and $v_p(A) \geq 2$. 
\vspace{1em}
In summary, 
\begin{equation}
    \prod_{d ' \mid d} C(E / F_{\fp}^{D_{d'}})^{\mu(d / d')}
    = 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & 3 \nmid d, \\
        1 & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{0, 3, 6, 9\}, \\
        1 \cdot \square & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{2, 10\}, \\
        3^a \cdot\square, a \in \{0,1\} & 3 \mid d, \delta \in \{4,8\}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

(There's no reason why we can't get 3; see elliptic curve 441b1 with additive reduction at $7$ of type IV and Tamagawa number equal to $3$)

However, it turns out we will only get $3$ occuring oddly when $d = 3$. Indeed, one has that $\langle \Ind_{D_{d'}}^D \trivial, \psi_3 \rangle = 1$ if $3 \mid d'$, and $0$ if $3 \nmid d'$, where $\psi_3$ is an irreducible character of $D$ of order $3$. Therefore one sees that the number of places with ramification degree divisible by $3$ cancels unless $d = 3$. Indeed, $\langle \chi_d , \psi_3 \rangle = 0$ unless $d = 3$, 
in which case it is $1$. Therefore (\ref{tam-contrib}) can only be non-square when $d = 3$.
