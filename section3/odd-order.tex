\subsection{Compatibility in odd order extensions}

In this section we work towards proving the following:

\begin{thm}
    Let $F / \bQ$ be a Galois extension of odd degree, with $G = \Gal(F / \bQ)$. 
    Consider a semistable elliptic curve $E / \bQ$ with good reduction at primes that are wildly ramified in $F / \bQ$.
    
    Then, for any $\rho \in R_{\bC}(G)$ with $[\bQ(\rho)\colon \bQ] > 1$, the function $f \colon B(G) \to
    \bQ^{\times} / N_{\bQ(\rho) / \bQ}(\bQ(\rho)^{\times})$ sending $H \mapsto C(E / F^{H})$ satisfies $f \sim_{\rho} 1$.
\end{thm}

We look at a relation of the form
\begin{equation}\label{reln} 
    \sum_i n_i \Ind_{H_i}^G \trivial \simeq \rho \oplus \tau(\rho),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is a character of $G$ with $\Gal(\bQ(\rho) / \bQ) = \langle \tau \rangle $ of size $2$. In particular we let $m$ denote the minimal positive integer such that $\bQ(\rho) \subset \bQ(\zeta_m)$. The sum on the left is over subgroups $H_i \subseteq G$. 

If I consider $\Res_D(\rho)$ where $D$ is a decomposition group of exponent $k$, then for $\Res_D(\rho)$ to be non-rationally valued, one needs $m |k$. Note that in the context of norm relations, if $\Res_D(\rho) = \Res_D(\tau(\rho))$, then we always get squares.

So now suppose that $D = I = C_n$ with $m | n$. Applying $\Res_D$ to (\ref{reln}), we get
\begin{equation}\label{reln-resD}
\sum_i n_i \sum_{x \in H_i \ G / D} \Ind_{D \cap x^{-1}H_i x}^D \trivial \simeq \Res_D \rho \oplus \tau(\Res_D \rho).
\end{equation}

Since both sides are now rationally valued, we can write this as $\sum_{d |n} a_d \cdot \chi_d$ where $a_d \in \bZ$ and $\{ \chi_d \colon d|n \}$ form a basis for the irreducible rational-valued representations of $D$. Explicitly, $\chi_d$ is the sum of the Galois conjugates of an irreducible complex character of $D$ with field of values $\bQ(\zeta_d)$ and kernel of index $d$ (which we'll write as $D_d$ ).

We can write each $\chi_d$ in terms of permutation modules:
\begin{equation}\label{chi-d} \chi_d = \sum_{d' | d} \mu(d' / d)\Ind_{D_d'}^D \trivial .\end{equation}
Substituting this into  $\sum_{d |n} a_d \cdot \chi_d$ gives an expression for the LHS of (\ref{reln}).
In particular, if we have a $D$-local function, we can evaluate it on each $\chi_d$-relation as in (\ref{chi-d}). Then the total expression is the product of these, raised to $a_d$.

Since we understand represntation theory of cyclic groups (wow!), we'd like to be able to reduce to cyclic decomposotion groups. Note that since we only assume bad reduction at tamely ramified primes in $F / \bQ$, one has that $I$ is cyclic. 
It turns out that we may assume that $D = I$ when $[D \colon I]$ is odd. 

\begin{lemma}
    In an odd degree unramified extension, Tamagawa numbers change only up to squares. In particular, if $[D \colon I]$ is odd, then $(D, I, \psi) \sim_{\rho} (I, I, \psi)$ for any $\rho$ with $\bQ(\rho)$ even. 
\end{lemma}
