The Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture classically provides a connection between the arithmetic of elliptic curves and their $L$-functions. We have already investigated the construction and main results of the `$L$-functions side', and now we turn out attention to statement of the conjecture and towards understanding the arithmetic terms present in the conjecture.
